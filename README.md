Simplest Optical Character Recognition :)

Step 1: just run Convert_IMG_TO_Numeric to get an idea about converting an image into pixel by pixel in Numeric Format.	It's the most important step because if you don't know how to convert an image to numeric, or how the image is converted to numeric in this project, then it's worthless to just execute a project!
	After running this file, you will see all numeric values as image in future.

Step 2: run Create_database.py to generate the dataset values for our project which is nothing but values from 0.1, 0.2 .... upto 9.9...which will be used to identify our input image and match with one of these images.

Step 3: actual execution step!
	Create any 8 x 8 image or edit test.png in images folder.
	Create any 8 x 8 image or draw any numeric value from 0 to 9....
	execute imagerec.py and measure the result.....

It's not yet using machine learning algorithm. It's just to understand the basics of Images in Numerics with Python....
Still it's recognizing the input images quite well...


****IN-FUTURE*****
We're now started working with OpenCV Library and soon upload a new OCR project with Machine Learning ability to learn from older images and identify the new ones :)
